## ONTOLOGY RESEARCH CONTEXT (FULL markdown from Agent 1):
Ontology Research Report
Input Text
N/A (JSON input treated as authoritative source data)

Summary
Identified Artifacts: File, NTFSFile, MftRecordFacet

Relevant CASE/UCO Classes (Objects): File, NTFSFile

Applicable Facets (Property Bundles): MftRecordFacet, NTFSFileFacet

Class Properties: accessedTime, allocationStatus, extension, fileName, filePath, isDirectory, metadataChangeTime, modifiedTime, observableCreatedTime, sizeInBytes

Facet Properties: alternateDataStreams, entryID, sid

Relationship Patterns: hasFacet, ObservableRelationship

Mapping Rationale
The primary artifact identified is a File, which is a fundamental object in digital forensics.
The NTFSFile class is specifically relevant due to its association with the NTFS file system, which is commonly encountered in forensic investigations.
The MftRecordFacet provides essential metadata characteristics for files in NTFS, making it a critical facet for understanding file properties.
The properties of the File class include timestamps and file attributes that are crucial for forensic analysis.
The NTFSFileFacet includes properties that further describe NTFS-specific characteristics, enhancing the understanding of the file's context.

Facet Associations
File: MftRecordFacet, NTFSFileFacet — these facets characterize the file's metadata and NTFS-specific properties.

Relationship Patterns
List proposed relationships as concise bullets:

Object-to-Facet Relationships:

File → hasFacet → MftRecordFacet — provides metadata characteristics for the file.
NTFSFile → hasFacet → NTFSFileFacet — provides NTFS-specific properties for the file.

## VALIDATION FEEDBACK FOR CORRECTION:




## INSTRUCTIONS:
Combine the standard ontology mapping with the custom facets into a unified JSON-LD structure.
Use the detailed ontology research context to make informed decisions about property usage and relationships.
Integrate both standard and custom properties logically.
Generate valid JSON-LD even if custom facets are empty.

## CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST return ONLY valid JSON-LD
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json```)
- Start with { and end with }
- Use proper JSON syntax: quotes around all keys and string values
- NO trailing commas
- Use the provided UUID Plan for all planned nodes' '@id' values; call 'generate_uuid' only for genuinely unplanned extras discovered during mapping

# If hallucination feedback is present in history, apply it precisely (remove fabricated fields, keep only input-grounded values)



## PREVIOUS OUTPUT (if any):



## AUTHORITATIVE INPUT DATA
There are **2** record(s). Use ONLY these values (no invention).

```json
[
  {
    "EntryNumber": 42,
    "SequenceNumber": 3,
    "ParentEntryNumber": 5,
    "FullPath": "\\Windows\\Prefetch\\MALICIOUS.EXE-12345678.pf",
    "InUse": true,

    "FN_Modified": "2025-01-20T16:33:11Z"
  }
]
```


## UUID PLAN (MANDATORY)
You MUST use the provided UUID PLAN exactly. Do not invent, alter, or drop any planned @id. 
If an entity has a planned @id, it MUST appear in @graph.

Use the pre-allocated IDs EXACTLY as provided. Do NOT invent or reuse.

```json

    "file": "kb:file-64b50618-702e-5621-9db1-34e5e9134035",
    "filefacet": "kb:filefacet-bcabcd81-461f-59e3-bb36-5554d5818a3a"
