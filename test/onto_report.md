Summary

Identified Artifacts: MFT Records

Forensic Significance: The Master File Table (MFT) records provide critical metadata about files on an NTFS filesystem, including creation, modification, and access timestamps, which are essential for timeline analysis and understanding file usage patterns.

Relevant CASE/UCO Classes (Objects): File, WindowsPrefetch, MftRecordFacet

Applicable Facets (Property Bundles): FileFacet

Class Properties: filePath, observableCreatedTime, modifiedTime, accessedTime, mftFileID, mftFileNameCreatedTime, mftFileNameModifiedTime

Facet Properties: mftFileID, mftFileNameAccessedTime, mftFileNameCreatedTime, mftFileNameModifiedTime, mftRecordChangeTime

Relationship Patterns: 
- File → hasFacet → MftRecordFacet
- WindowsPrefetch → hasFacet → WindowsPrefetchFacet

Mapping Rationale

- The input contains MFT Records, which are essential for understanding filesystem metadata.
- Because the input contains `EntryNumber`, I selected the `File` class to represent the files in the MFT.
- Because the input contains `FullPath`, I selected the `File` class to capture the file paths.
- Because the input contains timestamps like `SI_Created`, `SI_Modified`, and `SI_Accessed`, I selected the `MftRecordFacet` to capture the specific details of these timestamps.

| mftFileID | DatatypeProperty | Specifies the record number for the file within an NTFS Master File Table. | None | 1 | integer | None |
| mftFileNameCreatedTime | DatatypeProperty | The creation date and time recorded in an MFT entry for the file. | None | 1 | dateTime | None |
| mftFileNameModifiedTime | DatatypeProperty | The modification date and time recorded in an MFT entry for the file. | None | 1 | dateTime | None |

## WindowsPrefetch

| PROPERTY | PROPERTY TYPE | DESCRIPTION | MIN COUNT | MAX COUNT | LOCAL RANGE | GLOBAL RANGE |

## MftRecordFacet

| PROPERTY | PROPERTY TYPE | DESCRIPTION | MIN COUNT | MAX COUNT | LOCAL RANGE | GLOBAL RANGE |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| mftFileID | DatatypeProperty | Specifies the record number for the file within an NTFS Master File Table. | None | 1 | integer | None |
| mftFileNameAccessedTime | DatatypeProperty | The access date and time recorded in an MFT entry for the file. | None | 1 | dateTime | None |
| mftFileNameCreatedTime | DatatypeProperty | The creation date and time recorded in an MFT entry for the file. | None | 1 | dateTime | None |
| mftFileNameModifiedTime | DatatypeProperty | The modification date and time recorded in an MFT entry for the file. | None | 1 | dateTime | None |
| mftRecordChangeTime | DatatypeProperty | The date and time at which an NTFS file metadata was last changed. | None | 1 | dateTime | None |

Relationship Patterns

Object-to-Facet Relationships:
- File → hasFacet → MftRecordFacet — This relationship captures the metadata characteristics of the file as recorded in the MFT.
- WindowsPrefetch → hasFacet → WindowsPrefetchFacet — This relationship captures the execution details of the application associated with the prefetch file.

## Intelligent Ontology Modeling Analysis

**Evidence-Centric CASE/UCO Implementation Strategy:**

**Core Modeling Principle:** Represent each artifact as a **thing** (observable object class) with only its identity fields, and put all measured/derived values in an attached **facet** specific to that domain. Use a single **Evidence** node as the dynamic source of truth; each facet links to it (and optional tool-run activity) via provenance so every fact stays traceable and reproducible.

**Recommended Implementation Pattern for This Analysis:**

**Identity vs. Measurement Separation:**
- **Observable Objects (Things):** The identified classes `File`, `WindowsPrefetch`, and `MftRecordFacet` should contain only core identity properties like `filePath`, `mftFileID`, and `applicationFileName`.
- **Facets (Measurements):** The identified facets should contain all derived/measured values like `observableCreatedTime`, `mftFileNameCreatedTime`, and `mftRecordChangeTime`.

**Evidence Provenance Structure:**
- Create a single **Evidence** node representing the "NTFS filesystem analysis".
- Each facet links to this Evidence node via `uco-core:source` or `prov:wasDerivedFrom`.
- Tool execution details link via `prov:wasGeneratedBy` for full traceability.
- All timestamps, metadata, and derived forensic values trace back to the Evidence source.

**Key Insights from This Analysis:**
- The separation between identity properties (e.g., `filePath`, `mftFileID`) and measurement properties (e.g., `observableCreatedTime`, `mftRecordChangeTime`) is crucial for accurate forensic representation.
- The relationships identified provide a clear mapping of how files and their metadata are interconnected within the NTFS filesystem context.

**Implementation Hints for Other Agents:**
- **Identity Properties:** Keep minimal identifier fields with the observable object, such as `filePath` and `mftFileID`.
- **Measurement Properties:** Move all forensic metadata to domain-specific facets, such as `observableCreatedTime` and `mftRecordChangeTime`.
- **Provenance Chain:** Every measurement facet → Evidence node → Tool execution for complete traceability.
- **Relationship Strategy:** Ensure that relationships accurately reflect the interactions between objects based on the input data.
